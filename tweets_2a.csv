3123,"@politicshome Not going to happen, May is and always was sacrificial to her party so that nobody else's political career gets destroyed by Brexit. No reason to let her off the hook or put someone else there to get b*ggered."
3124,"@RLong_Bailey @UKLabour Presumably the jobs of the hundreds of thousands a people which have already been lost by the threat of brexit, and the thousands more to come don't count. Why are you supporting the Tories and the far right on brexit. Where are you Labour Values?"
3125,@ward_wardk4 @GMB_union @jeremycorbyn In my opinion - NO. No Labour leader should ignore what the party wants and work to destroy workers and human rights by supporting any form of brexit or support the racist UK damaging tory hate of the destruction of Freedom of Movement.
3126,"@RebetikoWalrus @OwenSmith_MP Supporting the far right, racist, jobs destroying, lives wrecking, tory flagship policy of brexit is damaging the Labour Party. Why is magic grandad supporting a policy of hate which only benefits rich tax dodgers at the expense of the people of the UK?"
3127,@OwenSmith_MP Corbyn is supporting a Tory brexit (there is no other sort) and by doing this is supporting the destruction of jobs and the living standard of the poorest and most vulnerable in the UK. Corbyn is betraying Labour values and principles so why is he still Labour leader?
3128,"@MickAntoniw1 ...... and if brexit is not stopped they'll be able to inflict low pay on us, destroy workers rights, human rights and the environmental  and other protections that the bosses don't want as these cost them money. #stopbrexit."
3129,@GMB_union @jeremycorbyn No one can be trusted to maintain workers rights is the horror of brexit goes ahead. Part of the point of brexit is so that bosses can get rid of EU workers rights so they can better exploit us. Anyone supporting any form of brexit is threatening workers rights.
