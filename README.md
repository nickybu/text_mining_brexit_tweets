## Abstract

Brexit has already began to have a significant impact on the job market, especially in the automotive industry. Topic modelling and sentiment analysis provide effective methods of identifying the public opinion towards Brexit, as well as the dominant areas of concern. We then used NER to identify the major geographical areas of interest. Our results showed that the general sentiment towards Brexit is negative and emphasised the significant impact on the automotive industry.
